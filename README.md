# Solving Poisson's Equation
A [web app](https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Electrostatics.html) solving [Poisson's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_equation) in electrostatics using [finite difference methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method) for discretization, followed by [gauss-seidel methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method) for solving the equations. Dirichlet conditions and charge density can be set. 

The demo can be found [here](https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Electrostatics.html).
The work is based on the notes found [here](http://www.ece.utah.edu/~ece6340/LECTURES/Feb1/Nagel%202012%20-%20Solving%20the%20Generalized%20Poisson%20Equation%20using%20FDM.pdf).

## Configurations
One can set various configurations such as voltage ([dirichlet conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_boundary_condition)), charge density configurations. 
Here are some of them. 

* Parallel Plate Capacitor

* Simple dipole

Various other configurations can be set using the editor in the app.
